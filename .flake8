# Ignore the following linter problems:
# * A003 class attribute "id" is shadowing a python builtin -> Class attributes don't really shadow
# * E704 multiple statements on one line (def) -> Seems to be faulty
# * W503 line break before binary operator -> We need the like break for complex cases
# * ANN101 Missing type annotation for self in method -> We won't annotate self
# * ANN102 Missing type annotation for cls in classmethod -> We won't annotate cls
# * ANN401 Dynamically typed expressions (typing.Any) are disallowed -> We allow Any
